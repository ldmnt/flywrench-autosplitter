Livesplit auto-splitting script for Flywrench 1.0.0.2 (Windows & Steam version).

### Features
- In-game timer for full game runs, planet time trials and individual level time trials.
- Auto-start on the prelude screen for full game runs and when starting a time trial.
- Auto-reset when clearing the save or when restarting time trials.
- Auto-splitting
    - between levels or planets for story mode (see the settings in livesplit);
    - between levels for time trials

### Todo
- Do not split when completing an already cleared level.
- Split planets correctly if the levels are completed in a weird order.
- Full customization of level splits.

### Notes
- In-game timer is precise up to milliseconds even during full game runs.
- Time trial time is not affected by the bug where the in-game timer displays :0X times incorrectly.
