### Current features
- In-game timer for full game runs, planet time trials and individual level time trials.
- Auto-start on the first level of pluto for full game runs and when starting a time trial.
- Auto-reset when clearing the save or when restarting time trials.

### To do
- Auto-splitting
	- at planet completion for full game runs,
