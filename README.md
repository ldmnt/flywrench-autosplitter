Livesplit auto-splitting script for Flywrench 1.0.0.2 (Windows & Steam version).

### Current features
- In-game timer for full game runs, planet time trials and individual level time trials.
- Auto-start on the first level of pluto for full game runs and when starting a time trial.
- Auto-reset when clearing the save or when restarting time trials.
- Auto-splitting between planets. It's based on the total amount of levels completed, so only works if the levels are completed in order.

### To do
- Auto-splitting for time trials.
- Better auto-splitting for full game runs (based individual level completion data).


### Notes
- In-game timer is precise up to milliseconds even during full game runs.
- Time trial time is not affected by the bug where the in-game timer displays :0X times incorrectly.
